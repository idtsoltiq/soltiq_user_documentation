![Overview3_2](assets/Overview3_2.png)

### **Item 1 – Emergency Stop Button Position**

!!! warning "The user must be familiar with the location of the emergency stop buttons before any use or handling of the charging station."

Pressing the emergency stop button deactivates all power outputs (including EV charging outlets and Schuko sockets) and interrupts the signal to the actuators that control the raising and lowering of the awning.

In the event of a charging station malfunction, EV-related issue, internet communication failure, or unintended movement of the awning, pressing the emergency stop button will place the system in a safe state.

!!! warning "Before restarting, the user must inspect the condition of the charging station. If there is any uncertainty, contact the SOLTIQ team at: [info@soltiq.eu](mailto:info@soltiq.eu)."

### **Item 2 and 5 – Schuko Single-Phase Outlets**

![Schuko](assets/Schuko.png)

These outlets are intended for powering single-phase devices, including e-bikes.

The voltage supplied to the outlets is 230 VAC / 50 Hz.

!!! info "The maximum permitted current (combined for both outlets) is 10 A."

!!! warning "Using the outlets during rain is not permitted. Protective covers must fully cover the sockets when not in use."

!!! warning "The socket covers must be in working condition to ensure protection of the electrical system from water and moisture ingress. If this condition is not met, stop using the charging station immediately and contact the SOLTIQ team at: [info@soltiq.eu](mailto:info@soltiq.eu)."

### **Item 3 and 6 – EV Vehicle Charging Connector**

Three-phase charging connector for electric vehicles, with the ability to charge at 8 kW or 4 kW per connector when two EVs are charging simultaneously.

  Check the charging station power supply.

- ⚪ **White**  
  The station is in standby mode or charging is complete.

- 🔵 **Blue**  
  Continuous: the station is waiting for a vehicle.  
  Flashing: the vehicle is charging.

- 🟢 **Green**  
  Charging is scheduled (e.g. Eco Mode, available in selected countries)  
  or awaiting a third-party response.

- 🟡 **Yellow**  
  Waiting for authentication or reservation.  
  Authenticate using the app or RFID key.

# **Awning Tension Cables and Inverter Ventilation**

![Overview7](assets/Overview7.png)

## **Item 1 – Tension Cables**

Tension cables increase the structural rigidity of the awning to reduce swaying during severe weather conditions.
